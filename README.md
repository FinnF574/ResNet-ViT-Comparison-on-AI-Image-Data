# ResNet-ViT-Comparison-on-AI-Image-Data
This is the repository linked to the DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN REAL AND AI-GENERATED FACES USING STATE-OF-THE-ART IMAGE CLASSIFICATION MODELS bachelor Thesis by Finn Franken and compares the performance of the ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer architectures on Ai-generated images and images of real human faces.
The FullBachelorMainfile.ipynb file contains all code used in this thesis, including code for preprocessing data into the correct format for use with the models.
